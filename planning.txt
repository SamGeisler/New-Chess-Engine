How to detect information about pawn structure based on bitboard: https://www.stmintz.com/ccc/index.php?id=271055
---------------------

-----GOALS-----
- Engine
    - Iterative deepened minimax with AB pruning and quiescence search
    - Transposition table
    - Improved static evaluation with bitboards
    - Some approach to move ordering
- GUI
- Perft test suite
- Basic solution to test different iterations against each other.
- LiChess API Implementation
    - TBD Goal rating (2300? More would be better. At least better than 98% or 99% of human players on LiChess)
---------------

-----GAME STATE REPRESENATION-----
Primary board struct:
    - Not copied: Minimax maintains a global struct
    - Approach taken from 'Denser board' representation from CPW:
    - array of 8 bit boards: white, black, pawns, knights, bishops, rooks, queens, kings (enum for each of these in the same order)
    - Likely addition: Add other bitboards (e.g. pawn attacks) which don't have to be updated after every move, but can save time when computing is_in_check or static_eval

Metadata struct: (For now, this will be implemented as a simple struct. I'm not sure of the best way to approach bitfields for performance, so I'll wait until I can experiment to reduce the size)
    - Combined with board struct into game state struct
    - Members:
        - castle flags (4 bits)
        - En passant right (square of where the pawn performing ep would move from, 0 for none)
        - FMR count

Move struct: (same as metadata struct)
    - 16 bit-bitfield
        - [12:15] Source square    
        - [8:11] Dest square
        - [6:7] Promotion piece (0-knight, 1-bishop, 2-rook, 3-queen)
    - All complexities handled in execute_move
    - Unexecution ambiguites (namely which piece was captured, en passant or not) saved when executing

Board arr:
    - Only used for rendering board and player control. Only updated from primary struct after engine makes move.
------------------------

-----MOVE GENERATION-----
Similar broad concept to old engine: Populate a 220-length array with move structs (just src, dest, promotion)
generate_moves first finds a pseudo legal move, executes it, and then checks if the king is in check. (using bitboards)

Move generation by piece:
    Pawns: For pushes, simple bitmap. For attacks, use a lookup table and bitwise and with enemey pieces.
    Knights: Lookup table
    Bishops, rooks, queens: Magic bitboards
    King: Lookup table
Each of these approaches produces a bitboard of destination squares given a source square. The primary generate_moves function appends a move struct for each location in the bitboard (after checking legality)

is_in_check is implemented with a simple attacking bitboard, which will be calculated on the fly

-----OLD ENGINE-----
//*Get_ai_move returns move struct by calling eval

eval:
    - Single recursion.
    - Array of move structs is allocated and populated by gen_moves
    - Once max_depth is reached, quiescence search is begun

quiescence search:
    - Single recursion. Calls generate_moves_CCP

gen_moves:
    - Loops over the board. For each piece found, calls the corresponding gen_blank_moves function. These functions all call append_move or try_append_move
    - Pawns: No loops, instead a very large if tree/chain to check for DPP, en-passant, promotions, etc.
    - Bishops, rooks, queens: Loops in every direction
    - Knights: Eight if statements with try_append_move
    - King: 8 try_append_move for adjacent squares, four if statements for castling. Each castling check moves the king and calls is_in_check to avoid castling through check.

try_append_move:
    - Append move if destination is not occupied by the same color. Simple check, calls append_move if it passes.

append_move:
    - inserts move into allocated array
    - Executes move (execute_move)
    - If is_in_check, unexecute_move

generate_moves_CCP:
    - Same as gen_moves but with variously modified if statements and exclusively append_move instead of try_append_move

is_in_check:
    - Check adjacencies, knight adjacencies, pawn adjacencies, and loop in every direction.

execute_move:
    - Update metadata - several ifs

unexecute_move:
    - Update metadata - several ifs


Metadata: (All chars)
    - castle flags (4 bits)
    - En passant right (square number)
    - FMR count (count)
    - Player to move (bit flag)
    - White king position (used for is_in_check to avoid looping) (square number)
    - Black king position (square number) 

Move struct: (all chars)
    - Source square
    - Destiniation square
    - pawn_promotion (doubles as flag and piece to promote to)
    - Reset FMR flag
    - Square to initiate en_passant right for, 0 if none
    - Castling flags: 4 bits, one if that castling right is voided by the move (may already be voided)
    - Piece id of piece captured, for unexecute_move
    - Flag if the move is en_passant, for unexecute_move
