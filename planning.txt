Board struct: Piece array and metadata
Player control info:

AI: Simple get_ai_move

Render: Simple call to render_board - Includes floating piece from player control info if necessary (add parameter?)

Player: get_player_move - halts execution and calls render_board every frame until move is made.

General: 
White: 0
Black: 1

Goals:
- Reasonably featured GUI
- Perft Suite
- Basic solution to test different iterations against each other.
- LiChess API Implementation
- Goal LiChess Rating (2300? More would be better. At least better than 98% or 99% of human players on LiChess)
